## Introduction

This reflection examines how the author’s principles from Clean Code (Chapters 2–11) have influenced the development of my Visual Schedule application. Each chapter is critically evaluated with concrete examples drawn from my codebase, as will become evident throughout the analysis.

## Chapter 2: Meaningful names

Throughout this development process, I have consistently followed Chapter 2's principle of meaningful names. I avoided abbreviations in my class names, choosing descriptive nouns like `ScheduleManager`, `CalendarController`, and `StorageService` that clearly reveal their intent. My method names use verbs that describe actions, such as `addActivityToDate()` and `getActivitiesForDate()`, making their purpose immediately clear. Variables like `dateKey` and `activitiesByDate` are both searchable and pronounceable, facilitating team communication and code navigation.

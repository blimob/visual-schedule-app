## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Architecture

This application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

* **Models** - Manage data and business logic (`CalendarModel`, `ScheduleManager`)
* **Views** - Handle DOM rendering and user interface (`MonthView`, `ActivityFormView`)
* **Controllers** - Coordinate between Models and Views (`CalendarController`, `ActivityController`)
* **Services** - Provide cross-cutting concerns (`StorageService`)

### Key Design Principles

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class has one reason to change
* **Dependency Injection** - Dependencies passed through constructors
* **Encapsulation** - Private fields using JavaScript `#` syntax
* **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between layers

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start local development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production (copies src/ and dependencies to public/) |
| `npm test` | Run Jest tests |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate test coverage report |

## Deployment

The app is configured for automatic deployment on **Netlify**:
1. **Push to GitHub** - Commits to `main`branch trigger deployment
2. **Build process** - Netlify runs `npm run build`
3. **Deploy** - Constents of `public/`directory are published

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
